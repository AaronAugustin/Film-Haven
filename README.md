# Film Haven
Welcome to the official Github repository of Film Haven.

## What is this?
Film Haven is a place where you can discover new films, watch trailers, and share your thoughts on popular movies.
This project was put together by [Aaron Augustin](https://github.com/AnimatingLegend), & [Jerome Foster](https://github.com/Yamuu07) to enhance the experience of searching, and reviewing movies. Think of it as Rotten Tomatos, or Letterbox, but better!

## Setup
Here are the steps to fork this repository, and the tools if needed:

- Go to your command line, and type ``git clone https://github.com/AaronAugustin/Film-Haven.git``.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is supported with this website, so it would need to be installed if you don't already have it.
    - After it's installed, go to the directory your project is in, and type ``npm install tmdb-js-wrapper``.

If you follow all of these steps above, the code should all be in your hands!

## Compiling the website
As for running the website itself, here are the steps on how to do so:

- For local use, run ``npm run dev``.
- For production use, run ``npm run build``.
