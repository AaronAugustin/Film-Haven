# Film Haven
Welcome to the official Github repository of Film Haven.

## What is this?
Film Haven is a place where you can discover new films, watch trailers, and share your thoughts on popular movies.
This project was put together by [Aaron Augustin](https://github.com/AnimatingLegend), & [Jerome Foster](https://github.com/Yamuu07) to enhance the experience of searching, and reviewing movies. Think of it as Rotten Tomatos, or Letterbox, but better!
